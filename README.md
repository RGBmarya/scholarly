- Provides explanations for highlighted text and cited research papers.
- Relates explanations to the context of the research, making it easier to understand complex concepts.

### Abstract-to-Text Hyperlinks
- Allows users to click on sentences in the abstract to navigate directly to the detailed sections of the paper.
- Enhances navigation and saves time by linking abstract points to their respective detailed discussions.

### Recommendation Engine
- Suggests similar papers and ones of interest based on past readings.
- Predicts impactful papers using machine learning and crowdsourced metrics, helping users stay ahead in their field of research.
- [Bodhi](https://github.com/RGBmarya/bodhi) creates an optimal paper reading path to efficiently grasp an area of research
